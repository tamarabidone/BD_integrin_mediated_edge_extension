# BD_integrin_mediated_edge_extension
BD model of integrin-mediated edge extension

Running model:
  To run a visual version of the model, run the script: LamellipodiumModel_Bidone01_NonFunction.m
  To run multiple runs while varying parameters, run or create a script like SimulationTaskList_001.m.
    Be sure to update set SaveDirectory on line 4.
    Engage MATLAB parallel processing before running, or comment out line 25 and relace with line 26.

Model output analysis:
  Assuming model code is run and raw output files are created (i.e. assuming you have run: SimulationTaskList_001.m),
  in Analysis_scripts_varying_spring_constant directory run analyis files in each folder followed by plotting code.
  Adjust Directory variables when necessary.
