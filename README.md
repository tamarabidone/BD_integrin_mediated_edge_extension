# BD_integrin_mediated_edge_extension
BD model of integrin-mediated edge extension

RUNNING MODEL:
  To run a visual version of the model, run the script: LamellipodiumModel_Bidone01_NonFunction.m.
  To run multiple runs while varying parameters, run or create a script like SimulationTaskList_001.m. 
  Be sure to update set SaveDirectory on line 4.
  Also, engage MATLAB parallel processing before running, or comment out line 25 and relace with line 26.
  Upon launching the code (visual or not), the code runs through a set of functions that are located within the folder.
  At first, the code 

MODEL OUTPUT ANALYSIS:
  Assuming model code is run and raw output files are created (i.e. assuming you have run the script: SimulationTaskList_001.m),
  in Analysis_scripts directory run analyis files in each folder followed by plotting code.
  Adjust raw data file read directory variables when necessary.
