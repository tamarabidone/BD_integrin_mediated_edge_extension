The "Actinflowanalysis.m" file is used to extract the retrograde flow of the actin network and the force on the adhesions from the raw files obtained from running the model. Thus, the model output obtained needs to be accessible through a specific path described in the Actinflowanalysis file. Upon running the Actinflowanalysis file, a .mat file will be generated containing a struct with two fields; one field storing the retrograde flow of connected filaments, and another storing the force on adhesions. This .mat file needs to be in the same folder as the retrogradeplotting file. Running the retrogradeplotting file will generate figures that will be saved in the same directory as the .mat file. Ideally you have them all in the same folder
