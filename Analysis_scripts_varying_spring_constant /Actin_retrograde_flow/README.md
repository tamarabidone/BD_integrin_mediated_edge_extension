The "Actinflowanalysis.m" file is used to extract the retrograde flow of the actin network and the force on the adhesions from the raw files obtained from running the model. Thus, the model output obtained needs to be accessible through a specific path in the Actinflowanalysis file. Upon running the Actinflowanalysis file, a .mat file will be generated containing the necessary information needed for the Retrogradeplotting file. This .mat file needs to be in the same folder as the retrogradeplotting file. Running the retrogradeplotting file will generate figures that will be saved in the same directory as the Actinflowanalysis and Retrogradeplotting files.
