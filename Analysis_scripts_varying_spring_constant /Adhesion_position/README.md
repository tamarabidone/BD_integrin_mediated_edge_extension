The "Adhesionpositionanalysis.m" file is used to extract the adhesion positions relative to the leading edge from the raw files obtained from running the model. Thus, the model output obtained needs to be accessible through a specific path described in the Adhesionpositionanalysis file. Upon running the Adhesionpositionanalysis file, a .mat file will be generated containing a struct which stores the position of the adhesions throughout the simulation. This .mat file needs to be in the same folder as the PositionPlotting file. Running the PositionPlotting file will generate figures that will be saved in the same directory as the .mat file. These figures will be histograms describing the distribution of adhesion positions for different substrate stiffnesses. The code plots this distribution for successive spring constants, as well as more extreme cases where the softest and stiffest spring constants are compared directly.
