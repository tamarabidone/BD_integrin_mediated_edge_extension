The "Adhesionforceanalysis.m" file is used to extract the force on the adhesions from the raw files obtained from running the model. 
Thus, the model output obtained needs to be accessible through a specific path described in the Adhesionforceanalysis file.
Upon running the Adhesionforceanalysis file, a .mat file will be generated containing a struct where the force on adhesions is stored for the whole simulation. This file will be saved in the same path as the Adhesionforceanalysis.m file
Running the Forceplotting file will generate figures that will be saved in the directory designated at the beginning of the code. The Forceplotting files contains two segments of code. The first segment will generate a histogram plot of the distribution of forces on adhesions for 3 different spring constants. The other segment of code will generate a figure plotting the mean and standard deviation of force on the adhesions for all 5 different spring constants.
