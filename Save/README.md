This folder contains the output files generated by the SimulationTaskList_001.m file. Substrate rigidities of 0.4, 6 and 60 kPa in WT and Mn2+ conditions were run with 40 repetitions for each condition. Different combinations of these are used to generate plots in the analysis scripts folder and should be saved in a directory that is referenced in a line at the start of each of the analysis files
